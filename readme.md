## Gathering social media data

A 2.5 hours hands-on workshop for the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/2025/saarbrucken/) hosted by the [Saarland Informatics Campus ](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/) in Saarbr√ºcken in September 2025.

This time we made heavy use of LLMs to help us generate the code. This was done on purpose to learn how to use LLMs effectively for coding. (Almost) no code was provided before the course.
